    "# Word embeddings\n",

    "\n",
    "Another popular and powerful way to associate a vector with a word is the use of dense \"word vectors\", also called \"word embeddings\". \n",
    "\n",
    "While the vectors obtained through one-hot encoding are binary, sparse (mostly made of zeros) and very high-dimensional (same dimensionality as the number of words in the vocabulary), \"word embeddings\" are low-dimensional floating point vectors (i.e. \"dense\" vectors, as opposed to sparse vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike word vectors obtained via one-hot encoding, word embeddings are learned from data. It is common to see word embeddings that are 256-dimensional, 512-dimensional, or 1024-dimensional when dealing with very large vocabularies. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, one-hot encoding words generally leads to vectors that are 20,000-dimensional or higher (capturing a vocabulary of 20,000 token in this case). So, word embeddings pack more information into far fewer dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://imgur.com/J4bWnf2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to obtain word embeddings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn word embeddings jointly with the main task you care about (e.g. document classification or sentiment prediction). In this setup, you would start with random word vectors, then learn your word vectors in the same way that you learn the weights of a neural network.\n",
    "* Load into your model word embeddings that were pre-computed using a different machine learning task than the one you are trying to solve. These are called \"pre-trained word embeddings\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at both.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Learning word embeddings with the Embedding layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to associate a dense vector to a word would be to pick the vector at random. The problem with this approach is that the resulting embedding space would have no structure: for instance, the words \"accurate\" and \"exact\" may end up with completely different embeddings, even though they are interchangeable in most sentences. It would be very difficult for a deep neural network to make sense of such a noisy, unstructured embedding space.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a bit more abstract: the geometric relationships between word vectors should reflect the semantic relationships between these words. Word embeddings are meant to map human language into a geometric space. For instance, in a reasonable embedding space, we would expect synonyms to be embedded into similar word vectors, and in general we would expect the geometric distance (e.g. L2 distance) between any two word vectors to relate to the semantic distance of the associated words (words meaning very different things would be embedded to points far away from each other, while related words would be closer). Even beyond mere distance, we may want specific directions in the embedding space to be meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world word embedding spaces, common examples of meaningful geometric transformations are \"gender vectors\" and \"plural vector\". For instance, by adding a \"female vector\" to the vector \"king\", one obtain the vector \"queen\". By adding a \"plural vector\", one obtain \"kings\". Word embedding spaces typically feature thousands of such interpretable and potentially useful vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://imgur.com/e6hn1F4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there some \"ideal\" word embedding space that would perfectly map human language and could be used for any natural language processing task? Possibly, but in any case, we have yet to compute anything of the sort. Also, there isn't such a thing as \"human language\", there are many different languages and they are not isomorphic, as a language is the reflection of a specific culture and a specific context. But more pragmatically, what makes a good word embedding space depends heavily on your task: the perfect word embedding space for an English-language movie review sentiment analysis model may look very different from the perfect embedding space for an English-language legal document classification model, because the importance of certain semantic relationships varies from task to task.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is thus reasonable to learn a new embedding space with every new task. Thankfully, backpropagation makes this really easy, and Keras makes it even easier. It's just about learning the weights of a layer: the Embedding layer."

    "The `Embedding layer` is best understood as a dictionary mapping integer indices (which stand for specific words) to dense vectors. It takes as input integers, it looks up these integers into an internal dictionary, and it returns the associated vectors. It's effectively a dictionary lookup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Embedding layer` takes as input a 2D tensor of integers, of shape `(samples, sequence_length)`, where each entry is a sequence of integers. It can embed sequences of variable lengths, so for instance we could feed into our embedding layer above batches that could have shapes `(32, 10)` (batch of 32 sequences of length 10) or `(64, 15)` (batch of 64 sequences of length 15). All sequences in a batch must have the same length, though (since we need to pack them into a single tensor), so sequences that are shorter than others should be padded with zeros, and sequences that are longer should be truncated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This layer returns a 3D floating point tensor, of shape `(samples, sequence_length, embedding_dimensionality)`. Such a 3D tensor can then be processed by a RNN layer or a 1D convolution layer (both will be introduced in the next sections).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you instantiate an Embedding layer, its weights (its internal dictionary of token vectors) are initially random, just like with any other layer. During training, these word vectors will be gradually adjusted via backpropagation, structuring the space into something that the downstream model can exploit. Once fully trained, your embedding space will show a lot of structure -- a kind of structure specialized for the specific problem you were training your model for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply this idea to the IMDB movie review sentiment prediction task that you are already familiar with. Let's quickly prepare the data. We will restrict the movie reviews to the top 10,000 most common words (like we did the first time we worked with this dataset), and cut the reviews after only 20 words. Our network will simply learn 8-dimensional embeddings for each of the 10,000 words, turn the input integer sequences (2D integer tensor) into embedded sequences (3D float tensor), flatten the tensor to 2D, and train a single Dense layer on top for classification."
