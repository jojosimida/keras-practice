    "# Understand the Difference Between Return Sequences and Return States for LSTMs in Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "The Keras API provides access to both return sequences and return state. The use and difference between these data can be confusing when designing sophisticated recurrent neural network models, such as the encoder-decoder model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "* That return sequences return the hidden state output for each input time step.\n",
    "* That return state returns the hidden state output and cell state for the last input time step.\n",
    "* That return sequences and return state can be used at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Long Short-Term Memory, or LSTM, is a recurrent neural network that is comprised of internal gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other recurrent neural networks, the network’s internal gates allow the model to be trained successfully using backpropagation through time, or BPTT, and avoid the vanishing gradients problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Keras deep learning library, LSTM layers can be created using the LSTM() class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a layer of LSTM memory units allows you to specify the number of memory units within the layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each unit or cell within the layer has an internal cell state, often abbreviated as *“c“*, and outputs a hidden state, often abbreviated as *“h“*.\n",
